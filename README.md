This repo holds the reference design for MODAQ2 which includes all the modules. Each module is its own Github Repo so changes to indivdual modules can be pushed to the remote repo and brough into new projects.

To Setup:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/NREL-MODAQ2/MODAQ2-RD.git
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
